# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

I found this project to be very entertaining. This was my first time working with VBA so it took a lot of seperate research to fully undertand the concepts of VBA. 

### Purpose

The Purpose of this project was to help Steve make a better recommendation to his parents regarding which stocks to invest their money in. Adding a visualization such as the table that compares both the 2017 and 2018 results allows steve and his parents to visualize the rise and fall of the stocks. 

## Results

Adding the visuals such as the colors (green for positve results and red for negative resuts) will allow Steve as well as his parents to better visualize and be pulled to the facts rather than choosing a random stock just because they liked the name.

### Results of 2017

In 2017 we see that most of the stocks had a total positive return all year. Some stocks even surpassed a 100% Return. In General, 2017 was a great year to invest in stocks and have a good return. The only stock that actually got a negative result (-7.2%) was TERP.

### Results of 2018

In the year 2018, we see the complete opposite regarding returns. Even though we are not told the cause, we can see by the numbers that the majority of stocks did very poorly. Most of them even had up to 62% of a returns loss. RUN and ENPH were the only two that had a positive return during 2018.

## Summary
 
 Based on the given results from both the 2017 and 2018 tables Steve can better help his parents choose a stock to invest their rmoney in. RUN and ENPH were the only two that had positive returns on both years. Perhaps he should recmommed these two to his parents. If they want to invest in another stock that is not RUN nor ENPH they could also choose one of the stocks that did not lose too much such as VSLR or SEDG. TERP had negative results in both 2017 and 2018, so they might want to stay away from this one. 

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring code

Refactoring code is one very easy way for employers to see how you are doing in a particular langauge. Refactoring allows programmers and analysts to run code in faster and sometimes easier ways. A diadvatage is that sometimes, when not prepared properly, refactored code can throw you off balance if you only know one way to do things. Refactoring code allows you to broaden your horizons and challenge you to learn new ways to get the same results, even if its not always the easiest way. 

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring the VBA Script 

I struggled a lot with getting my refactored code to run. I kept runnning into a debug error that I could not seem to be able to get to the bottom of. Additionally, I did not understand why on one part of the problem, instead of a nested loop that we had in the original code, they wanted us to instead use to different **for loops**. However, as stated previously, refactoring code is meant to challenge that and allow you to find more than one way to achieve the same result.
