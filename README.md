### Results of 2017

In 2017 we see that most of the stocks had a very total positive return all year. Some stocks even surpassed a 100% Return. In General, 2017 was a great year to invest in stocks and have a good return. The only stock that actually got a negative result (-7.2%) was TERP.

### Results of 2018

In the year 2018, we see the complete opposite regarding returns. Even though we are not told the cause, we can see by the numbers that the majority of stocks did very poorly. Most of them even had up to 62% of a returns loss. RUN and ENPH were the only two that had a positive return during 2018.
