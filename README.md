# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

I found this project to be very entertaining. This was my first time working with VBA so it took a lot of sepearte research to fully undertand the concepts of VBA. 

### Purpose

The Purpose of this project was to help Steve make a better recommendation to his parents regarding which stocks to invest their money. Adding a visualization such as the table that compares both the 2017 and 2018 results allows steve and his parents to visualize the rise and fall of the stocks. 

## Results

Adding the visuals such as the colors (green for positve results and red for negative resuts) will allow Steve as well as his parents to better visualize and be pulled to the facts rather than choosing a random stock just because they liked the name of the stock. 

### Results of 2017

In 2017 we see that most of the stocks had a very total positive return all year. Some stocks even surpassed a 100% Return. In General, 2017 was a great year to invest in stocks and have a good return. The only stock that actually got a negative result (-7.2%) was TERP.

### Results of 2018

In the year 2018, we see the complete opposite regarding returns. Even though we are not told the cause, we can see by the numbers that the majority of stocks did very poorly. Most of them even had up to 62% of a returns loss. RUN and ENPH were the only two that had a positive return during 2018.
